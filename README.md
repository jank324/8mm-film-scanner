# 8mm-film-scanner


## Run yourself

Clone repository (`Desktop`).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jank324/8mm-film-scanner.git
```

Install python packages

```sh
sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Need *npm* installed.

`cd` to `frontend` directory.

```sh
cd frontend
```

install packages

```sh
npm install
```

then build frontend via

```sh
npm run build
```

`cd` back to the project root (`..`) then you can start the server by running

```sh
sudo python3 server.py
```

You probably want to run the server on boot of the Pi ...

This repository provides a *systemd* service `8mmfilmscanner.service` that runs the 8mm Film Scanner's server on boot. To set up the service, copy the `.service` file to `/etc/systemd/system` by running

```bash
sudo cp 8mmfilmscanner.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

and then enable it via

```bash
systemctl enable 8mmfilmscanner
```

### (Optional) Send scan complete notification e-mails

If you want the server to send e-mails when scan finish

create mail account of your choice

create file `notification_config.yaml` in project root directory

Fill in the following with the details of your mail account and the mail address you want e-mails to be sent to

```yaml
user: scanners@mail.com         # Address of the scanner's account
password: scannerspassword123   # Password of the scanner's account
to: your@mail.com               # Address notifications are sent to (presumably your own)
```

Please remember to **NEVER** commit `notification_config.yaml` as it contains the password to the scanner's mail account which should remain secret. Under normal circumstances, this repository's `.gitignore` should already take care of this.
