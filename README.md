# 8mm Film Scanner

The *8mm Film Scanner* is a project to build a scanner for digitising motion picture film in both the *Regular 8* and *Super 8* gauges by converting an old projector with the help of a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) single board computer.

In this repository, I have collected all my materials on this project, including source code, information on the hardware and software design, instructions for using the software, a rundown of my scanning and editing workflow, and many more.

## Introduction

I while ago, I found myself with over 800 rolls of 8mm film my grandfather had filmed throughout the 1960s, 70s and 80s. Having just digitised my grandparents' photo collection, naturally I wanted to know what was on these 8mm films and digitise them as well, so they would be safe from further deterioration and so we would actually watch them instead of always being too lazy to set up the projector.

Now, the easiest way to get films like these digitised is the use of a digitisation service. But for the sheer amount of film I had, this would have cost me well over 10,000â‚¬ and with these services you never know whether you will actually get a decent quality scan. The next option was to just get out the old projector and use a video camera to record the films as they play. This is a perfectly valid option and super easy to do, but the resulting recordings usually suffer from distortion, bad colours, a lack of sharpness and quite a bit of flicker. To do the true quality of these films justice, what was really needed was a frame-by-frame scanner. You can actually buy these but the ones available are either so expensive that they only make sense for professional users (e.g. scanners by [Filmfabriek](https://filmfabriek.nl)) or they leave a lot to be desired in terms of quality (like the famed [Wolverine](https://www.wolverinedata.com/products/MovieMaker_Pro)).

The solution is to build your own scanner, an idea that got hooked on after finding a [video on the AACA Library's *Mike's Movie Machine*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luGacxJMZI8), which is really just an incarnation of the absolutely amazing [*Kinograph*](https://www.kinograph.cc) project. TODO [Kinograph Forums](https://forums.kinograph.cc)

In the following, you will find a detailed description of my *8mm Film Scanner* and the workflow around it. The scanner is built around an old dual-gauge film projector and a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) single board computer.

Below you find a photo of my scanner, a screenshot of its web interface as well as a sample scan.

TODO Insert photo, screenshot and sample scan.

The rest of this README is intended as a documentation of every detail and lesson learned about my scanner. The goal here is to provide all the information and source code necessary to build another one.

### Installation

Not tested because I have only one piece of hardware

Ensure same connections as those described above as well as Raspberry Pi with Raspberry Pi OS installed as normal

Clone repository (`Desktop`).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jank324/8mm-film-scanner.git
```

Install python packages

```sh
sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Need *npm* installed.

`cd` to `frontend` directory.

```sh
cd frontend
```

install packages

```sh
npm install
```

then build frontend via

```sh
npm run build
```

`cd` back to the project root (`..`) then you can start the server by running

```sh
sudo python3 server.py
```

You probably want to run the server on boot of the Pi ...

This repository provides a *systemd* service `8mmfilmscanner.service` that runs the 8mm Film Scanner's server on boot. To set up the service, copy the `.service` file to `/etc/systemd/system` by running

```bash
sudo cp 8mmfilmscanner.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

and then enable it via

```bash
systemctl enable 8mmfilmscanner
```

then to send email notifications on finished scans

create mail account of your choice

create file `notification_config.yaml` in project root directory

Fill in the following with the details of your mail account and the mail address you want e-mails to be sent to

```yaml
user: scanners@mail.com         # Address of the scanner's account
password: scannerspassword123   # Password of the scanner's account
to: your@mail.com               # Address notifications are sent to (presumably your own)
```

Please remember to **NEVER** commit `notification_config.yaml` as it contains the password to the scanner's mail account which should remain secret. Under normal circumstances, this repository's `.gitignore` should already take care of this.
